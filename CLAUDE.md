- We will use GitHub issues to track our progress throughout this project. When starting a new task, check if a relevant GitHub issue exists. If not, create one. 

As you make changes, commit after every task and any time you have modified at least 2 files. We don’t want massive amounts of uncommitted changes.

The repo is Shoot2Skoot/ai-think-tank.

When you work on an issue comment with updates on your progress. Then confirm you have met all requirements of the issue. If you have, close the issue. 

When the user asks what’s next, check the list of open issues and use that as well as your context.

Use Context7 whenever you need to confirm your understanding or check docs.

Use sequential thinking when you approach longer or more complex problems.
